Key Highlights: Employee attrition happens when an employee leaves an organization for any reason and is not replaced for a long time, or not ever. It often results in a decrease in the size of an organization’s or department’s workforce because positions aren’t refilled when employees leave.

Attrition can occur throughout an entire company or just in certain departments or divisions. This typically happens when automation or new technologies replace employees.

For example, a car manufacturing factory might have previously required workers for assembly line tasks such as attaching wheels or installing windshields. With advancements in automation, these tasks could be taken over by robotic arms and machines, thus reducing assembly line workforce needs.

Employee attrition is measured by calculating the attrition rate.
